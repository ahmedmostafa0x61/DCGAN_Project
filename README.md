# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

This repository implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) in PyTorch. DCGANs are generative models that can create realistic images by training two neural networks in competition: a generator that tries to create plausible images, and a discriminator that attempts to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Project Overview

This project implements a DCGAN from scratch in PyTorch, used to generate images from a specified dataset. The generator network learns to produce realistic images, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real images from the dataset and fake images produced by the generator.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DCGAN_Project.git
cd DCGAN_Project

# Set up virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the DCGAN model:

```bash
python train.py
```

This command will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train the DCGAN model.
3. Save model checkpoints and generated samples.

### Generate Images

To generate images with a trained model:

```bash
python generate.py --model_path path/to/saved_model.pth
```

## Model Architecture

### Generator

The generator network uses a series of transpose convolutional layers to transform a random noise vector into a realistic image. Key components include:
- Transposed Convolutions: For up-sampling.
- Batch Normalization: To stabilize training.
- Activation Function: `ReLU` activations for all layers except the last, which uses `Tanh` for image output.

### Discriminator

The discriminator is a convolutional neural network that classifies images as real or fake. Key components include:
- Convolutions: For down-sampling.
- Batch Normalization: To stabilize training.
- Activation Function: `Leaky ReLU` for introducing non-linearity.

## Training

To train the DCGAN model:
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Place your dataset in a folder structure that can be loaded by PyTorch (e.g., `data/images`).
2. **Configure Hyperparameters**: Adjust batch size, learning rate, and other parameters in `config.py`.
3. **Run Training**: Execute `python train.py`. Training progress and generated images will be saved in the `outputs` directory.

### Hyperparameters
- `z_dim`: Dimension of the noise vector.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for both generator and discriminator optimizers.
- `batch_size`: Number of samples in each batch.

## Results

Here are some example images generated by the DCGAN model:
